# Assignment 2 - Git
Description: This folder was created to store all required files to successfully complete assignment 2 for the topics of Git and GitHub. Additionally, it contains a source file and script that can be used to run Assignment 1 for the topic of Unix and Bash.

## How to use files/code in this folder:
1. Navigate to the 'inputs' folder to read about assignments 1 and 2 as well as explore the data source file used in assignment 1.
2. Moving on to the 'scripts' folder, you will find the shell script file that can be used to execute the code/commands required to complete assignment 1. 
3. Folder 'outputs' display the result of running assignment 1's shell script, which is the extracted column from the source file.
