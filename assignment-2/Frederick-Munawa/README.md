# Assignment 2 [![Awesome](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sindresorhus/awesome@d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme)

## Description
This repo contains Frederick Munawa's DSI assignment 2 submission.

## Project usage
This submission contains a script that prints Toronto parking ticket infractions and provides the mean, minimum, and maximum fine for the entire data set. Finally, the script saves a list of all "prohibited time" parking infractions (code "29") as a separate csv file in the outputs folder. 

## Getting started
1. Open the command line terminal
2. Give the script <assignment-1.sh> permission to excute (e.g. "chmod 775 assignment-1.sh")
3. Provide the csv file with the appropriate data then run the script (e.g. "./scripts/assignment-1.sh inputs/parking_data.csv")
4. You're all done!
