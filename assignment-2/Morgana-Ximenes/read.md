# Parking Data Information Parsing Program

## Description: This is a project completed as part of an assignment for DSI classes


## Summary: This script allows users to parse through a csv file(parking_data.csv) and perform three functions:

- One to select and print all type of infractions contained in the file. 
- Another function to find the mean, min and max fine amounts for the infractions
- The third function selects one type of infraction ('PARK ON PRIVATE PROPERTY') and save it into output.csv while maintaing the original csv heading.
